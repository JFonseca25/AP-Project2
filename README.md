# AP-Project2
Repo for the second Deep Learning course's project (2021/22).

In this project, we used PyTorch for two main tasks:
- classify images of individual clothes as belonging to a certain class of clothing;
- implement an automatic caption generator for sattelite images. To this end, we utilised Encoder-Decoder architectures with and without an Attention mechanism, accompanied by a pretrained ResNet to process the images.
