# AP-Project2
Repo for the second Deep Learning course's project (2021/22).

In this project, we used PyTorch to implement an automatic caption generator for sattelite images. To this end, we utilised Encoder-Decoder architectures with and without an attention mechanisms, accompanied by a Convolutional Neural Network.
